# How to implement an A/B test in Ruby using Feature Flags

#### [Read the blog post here](https://configcat.com/blog/)

This repository contains the accompanying sample code for the blog article titled 'How to Implement an A/B Test in Ruby Using Feature Flags.' The application relies on the Sinatra gem to serve the landing page through the browser. To conduct the A/B test experiment, I've integrated [ConfigCat feature flags](https://configcat.com) for switching between and deploying each version to different user groups. Additionally, I've incorporated the Amplitude data analytics platform to analyze the impact of each version, to select the best one for deployment.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Latest version of [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) installed on your machine.
- A text editor of your choice. I'll be using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for this demo.
- Basic knowledge of [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Sinatra](https://sinatrarb.com/)

### Build

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a `.env` file in the root of the repo with the following content:

```sh
AMPLITUDE_API_KEY="YOUR-AMPLITUDE-API-KEY-GOES-HERE"
CONFIGCAT_SDK_KEY="YOUR-CONFIGCAT-SDK-KEY-GOES-HERE"
```

3. Add your ConfigCat SDK key and your Amplitude API key to it.

4. Install the Gemfile dependencies:

```sh
bundle install
```

### Run

Execute the following command to launch the app in your browser:

```sh
ruby app.rb
```

The app should now be visible at: <http://localhost:4567>
